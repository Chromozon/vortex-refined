Sentry is an [Engineer](../classes/engineer.md) ability which places a sentry gun down in front of the user.
The sentry gun automatically tracks targets and fires bullets and rockets at them.

The sentry gun has three upgrade levels. When a sentry is placed, it starts at upgrade level 1. It costs 25 power cubes to upgrade a sentry, which may be done by simply touching it.

Each upgrade level increases the gun damage by 20%.

The sentry gun is affected by [Conversion](conversion.md).
The sentry gun is affected by [Holy Freeze Aura](holy_freeze.md).
The sentry gun is not affected by [Strength](strength.md) or [Earth Totem](strength_totem.md).
